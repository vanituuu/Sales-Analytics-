SQL Sales Analytics Project
 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to design a relational database and perform business data analysis on sales transactions.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights such as customer behavior, product performance, revenue trends, and payment analysis.

This project simulates a real-world e-commerce sales system and showcases practical SQL skills used in Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles.

Database Schema

The database consists of five related tables:

customers – Customer demographic and signup details

products – Product information, categories, and prices

orders – Customer order records

order_items – Products included in each order

payments – Payment status for each order

These tables are connected using primary keys and foreign keys to maintain relational integrity.

 Skills & Concepts Demonstrated

Database design and table relationships

SQL Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

GROUP BY and HAVING clauses

Subqueries

Revenue and performance analysis

View creation for reusable insights

Business Questions Answered

This project answers real business-style questions such as:

Total number of customers, orders, and order items

City-wise customer distribution

Customers with multiple orders

Top 5 most sold products

Revenue generated by each product

Revenue generated by each customer

Highest spending customer

Monthly order trends

Revenue by product category

Orders with failed payments

Customers who spent more than the average customer

 Example Insights

Identified top-performing products based on sales volume

Calculated customer lifetime revenue

Analyzed monthly sales patterns

Measured failed vs successful payment rates

Found high-value customers for targeted marketing

 How to Run This Project

Create a new database:

CREATE DATABASE sales_analytics;
USE sales_analytics;

Run the table creation queries from the script.

Insert the sample data provided.

Execute the analysis queries to generate business insights.
